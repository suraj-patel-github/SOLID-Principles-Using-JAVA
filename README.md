# SOLID-Principles-Using-JAVA
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles in Java with simple and practical examples. SOLID is an acronym that represents five key object-oriented design principles that help developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software.

# What SOLID stands for:
S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Applis to inheritance in such a way that the derived class must be completely substitutable for their base classes. In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interupting the behaviour of the the program.

I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
