# SOLID-Principles-Using-JAVA
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles in Java with simple and practical examples. SOLID is an acronym that represents five key object-oriented design principles that help developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software.

# What SOLID stands for:
S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Applis to inheritance in such a way that the derived class must be completely substitutable for their base classes. In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interupting the behaviour of the the program.

I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
This states that the larger interfaces split into smaller ones. Because the implementation classes use only the methods that are required. We should not farce the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.

D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
States that we must use abastraction(abstract classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. High level modules should not depend on the low-level module but both should depened on the abstraction.
